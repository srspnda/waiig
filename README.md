# Writing An Interpreter In Go

The `code/` directory is content distributed as a companion guide to the [waiig book](https://interpreterbook.com/),
and can be found [here](https://interpreterbook.com/waiig_code_1.3.zip). See `code/LICENSE`,
and `code/README.md` for details.

The `src/` directory will be for my progress within the book. Many thanks to the author!
